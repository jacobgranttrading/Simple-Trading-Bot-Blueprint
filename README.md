# Simple-Trading-Bot-Blueprint


This project provides a comprehensive guide to building automated trading bots using three different approaches: EC2 Instance with Polygon and MetaTrader5, TradingView with Lambda and Alpaca, and Pine Script on TradingView. These bots can be used to trade Forex and stocks automatically.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the installation, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- AWS account with permissions to launch an EC2 instance and create Lambda functions and API Gateway (for methods 1 and 2)
- Polygon API key (for method 1)
- MetaTrader5 account and platform installation (for method 1)
- Alpaca account (for method 2)
- TradingView account (for methods 2 and 3)
- Broker account integrated with TradingView (for method 3)
- Basic knowledge of Python and a Python IDE (for method 1)

## Installation

Follow the instructions below to set up the automated trading bot for each method:

### 1. EC2 Instance - Polygon & MetaTrader5

1. Launch an EC2 instance on AWS and set up the necessary security groups.
2. Connect to the instance and install Python, a Python IDE, and the MetaTrader5 platform.
3. Install the required Python libraries: `pip install MetaTrader5 polygon-api`.
4. Download the Python script that fetches data from Polygon, analyzes it, and executes trades on MetaTrader5.
5. Run the Python script to start the automated trading bot.

### 2. TradingView - Lambda - Alpaca

1. Create an API Gateway on AWS to accept HTTP POST requests from TradingView Webhook alerts.
2. Set up a Lambda function that accepts data from the API Gateway and integrates with the Alpaca API to execute trades.
3. Configure alerts on TradingView to send Webhook requests to the API Gateway URL.
4. Test your setup by creating a test alert on TradingView and verifying that it triggers the Lambda function and Alpaca trade execution.

### 3. Pinescript on TradingView

1. Create a trading strategy using Pine Script in the TradingView platform.
2. Backtest and optimize your strategy using historical data.
3. Connect your TradingView account to a broker that supports your strategy.
4. Activate your strategy for live trading and monitor its performance.


How to Use This Script:
Open Pine Script Editor: In your TradingView account, open the Pine Script editor.

Create a New Script: Create a new script and paste the sample Pine Script provided above.

Customize the Script: You can customize the script to suit your trading preferences. For example, you can adjust the periods of the moving averages or change the strategy.

Backtest and Optimize: Test your strategy using historical data and make adjustments to improve performance.

Connect to Broker: Make sure your TradingView account is linked with a broker that supports your strategy and that auto-trading is enabled.

Activate Strategy: Once you are satisfied with your strategy and have thoroughly tested it, activate it for live trading.

Monitor the Strategy: Regularly monitor the strategy and make any necessary adjustments to keep it running smoothly.


## Usage

After completing the installation steps for your chosen method, your automated trading bot will be up and running. Monitor the bot's performance and make adjustments as necessary based on market conditions and trading results.
